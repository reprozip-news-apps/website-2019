		<p class="lead">An IMLS funded project to build prototype to enable systematic collection & preservation of dynamic websites.</p>
		<hr class="my-4">
		<p>Storytelling with data has revolutionized modern reporting, and the dramatic increase in the production and popularity of data journalism projects can be seen both at news startups, as well as at legacy news organizations. These stories are an important part of the historical record, yet due to their technological complexity they cannot currently be archived or preserved at libraries, newsrooms, or cultural institutions. As such, they are disappearing. This project will alleviate some of this problem.</p>
