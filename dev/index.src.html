	<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	<p>The Division of Libraries, Center for Data Science, and Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University seek a developer to work on an innovative, IMLS-funded project working to preserve interactive web applications for data journalism. These applications are typically made of a database, a web server, a web application and a frontend. To fully capture these disparate parts, the Project Team will work to integrate ReproZip (an open source tool for reproducible research) and open source front-end web archiving tools (e.g. Webrecorder) into one tool to fully capture functionality of modern interactive web applications. The project team includes data journalists, librarians, and software engineers.</p>

	<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
	<p>We are looking for a talented developer who is passionate about creating tools and infrastructure to support web archiving. Candidates will work collaboratively to build a tool that will transform and streamline preservation of web applications. For this project, the Developer will add open-source web crawling functionality to ReproZip to fully capture interactive web applications. This prototype will be tested with data journalism applications and updated as new functional specifications emerge.</p>

		<li>The Developer will work with the Project Team to update the prototype functionality as testing continues.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>QUALIFICATIONS</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science or related technical fields, or equivalent programming background</li>
		<li>Experience in software development methodology and tools</li>
		<li>Knowledge of C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and SQL (Ruby is a plus)</li>
